## Input Data

The dataset includes the following files:
- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

## Output Data

The resulting tidy_data.txt dataset includes mean and standard deviation variables for the following original variables:

> tBodyAcc-XYZ, tGravityAcc-XYZ, tBodyAccJerk-XYZ, tBodyGyro-XYZ, tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ, tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag, fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccMag, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag

All three X, Y, Z directions are included.
The above variables where choosen as they included either *mean* or *std* in their original names.


## Transformations

The script `run_analysis.R` does the following things:
- Load the various files which make-up the UCI dataset
- Merges the three test and three train files into a single data table, setting textual columns heading where possible
- Creates a smaller second dataset, containing only mean and std variables
- Computes the means of this secondary dataset, group by subject/activity.
- Saves this last dataset to tidy_data.txt
